`ändern` helps with tracking changes across an object tree. Use it to wrap and modify an object, and you'd get [observables](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) notifying you when [some part of the object](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) changes, and [what the changes are](https://jsonpatch.com).

```js
import { createRoot } from 'andern'

const root = createRoot({
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ]
})

// 👇 subscribe to a part of the tree
root.child('/people/1').subscribe(console.log)

// 👇 manually set a specific part of the tree
root.child('/people/1/age').set('', 32)

// 👇 apply a patch to a specific part of the tree
root.child('/people').patch({ op: 'remove', path: '/1/age' })

```

# Installation

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):

```bash
npm i andern
```

Browser / [Deno](https://deno.land):

```js
import { createRoot } from 'https://esm.sh/andern'
```

<br>

# Usage

`ändern` helps with propagating and tracking changes across some object (for example, managing application state). It treats the object as a tree: the root represents the whole object, and child nodes representing various parts of it. You can subscribe to different parts of the tree, modify or patch them, etc, and `ändern` will make sure that all changes are propagated exactly to the correct subscribers.


👉 Create a root node:
```js
import { createRoot } from 'andern'

const root = createRoot({
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ]
})
```
<br>

👉 Get a child node:
```js
const john = root.child('/people/0')
```

> Child nodes are specified in [JSON Pointer](https://gregsdennis.github.io/Manatee.Json/usage/pointer.html) format.

<br>

👉 Subscribe to a node's values:
```js
john.subscribe(console.log)
root.child('/people/1').subscribe(console.log)
```

> Each node is an [observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) that emits the current value of the node whenever it changes.

<br>

👉 Update the node:
```js
john.set('/name', 'Johnny')
```
```js
john.add('/title', 'Dr.')
```
```js
john.remove('/age')
```

> To change the whole object, use `''` as the path. Alternatively, you can use `node.next(...)`, as each node is also an [observer](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer).

<br>

👉 Subscribe to its changes:
```js
john.patches.subscribe(console.log)
```

👉 Apply a patch:
```js
john.patch({ op: 'replace', path: '/name', value: 'Johnny' })
```

> Changes are expressed in [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com) format.

<br>

👉 Use `.read()` method to get readonly nodes:

```js
const john = root.read('/people/0')
```

<br>

# Advanced Usage

### Nodes

The core construct of `ändern` is the [`Node`](./src/node.ts) class, which tracks and notifies of changes in some part of an object tree.

```ts
class Node<T>
  extends Observable<T>
  implements Observer<T> {

  constructor(
    initial:  T,
    downstream: PatchStream,
    upstream: PatchChannel,
  );

  read(path: string): ReadonlyNode<T>;
  child(path: string): Node<T>;
  channel(): Observer<Patch>;
  patch(patch: Patch | Operation): this;
  set(path: string, value: any): this;  
  remove(path: string): this;

  // and some inherited methods
}
```

To create a `Node`, you need an _upstream_ and a _downstream_:

- _downstream_ should be a [`PatchStream`](./src/types.ts) (i.e. [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable)[`<Patch>`](https://jsonpatch.com)), through which the parent informs the node of changes to its value.

- _upstream_ should be a [`PatchChannel`](./src/types.ts) (i.e. [`Observer`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer)[`<Patch>`](https://jsonpatch.com)), through which the node informs its parent of requested changes to its value.

<br>

When a node is requested to change (through its `.set()`, `.remove()`, `.patch()`, or `.next()` methods), it will calculate the necessary changes and send them to _upstream_. It will apply the changes when they are received from the _downstream_, notifying subscribers ([read more](#how-it-works)).

Use this to create nodes with custom behavior. For example, this is a _root node_ that debounces incoming changes:

```ts
import { Node } from 'andern'
import { Subject, debounceTime } from 'rxjs'

const bounce = new Subject()
const root = new Node(
  { /* some initial value */},
  bounce.pipe(debounceTime(100)),
  bounce,
)
```

</div>

### Safety

A `Node` receiving a patch that it can't apply will result in an error, closing the stream. This can happen, when for example another node sends a conflicting patch earlier.

Use `SafeNode` class to ignore erroneous patches.

```ts
import { SafeNode } from 'andern'

const root = new SafeNode(
  /* ... */
)
```

<br>

> `createRoot()` uses `SafeNode` by default, so you don't need to worry about safety in normal use cases. You need to think about it only if you're creating custom nodes.

<br>

# How it Works

`ändern` uses trees, composed of [`Node`](#nodes)s, for tracking changes across objects. Each node is an [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) and an [`Observer`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer) for a designated part of the tree, represented by some [JSON pointer](https://gregsdennis.github.io/Manatee.Json/usage/pointer.html). For an object (tree) like this:

```js
const object = {
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ],
  orgname: 'ACME',
}
```

You can track (or apply) changes to the organisation name like this:

```ts
const root = createRoot(object)
const orgname = root.child('/orgname')
```

you can track (or apply) changes to the first person's name like this:

```ts
const john = root.child('/people/0/name')
```

<br>

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> `ändern` does not track changes made to objects directly. A `Node` can only track changes that are applied by (or via) other nodes in the same tree.

<br>

### Step 1: Initialisation

When a change is requested (through `.set()`, `.remove()`, `.patch()`, or `.next()` methods), the node will NOT apply the change, instead calculating the necessary alterations and sends them, as a [patch](https://jsonpatch.com), to its parent (via its _upstream_).

> ⚠️ _`.next()` compares the node's current and given values to calculate the patch, making it computationally expensive compared to other mutation methods._

<br>

### Step 2: Up-propagation

The parent updates the patch's _path_ so that it reflects the child it originated from, then sends it to its own parent. Eventually, the patch reaches the root and is bounced back ([if valid](#safety)).

> 💡 _The root is like other nodes, except its downstream and upstream are the same (a [`Subject`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject)), resulting in the root bouncing back incoming patches. The root created by `createdRoot()` is a [`SafeNode`](#safety), so it also checks validity of bounced patches, dropping invalid ones._

<br>

### Step 3: Down-propagation

Starting with the root, each node then sends the patch to its matching children, recorrecting the path for each matching child. Each node also applies the patch and notifies its subscribers. The patch eventually reaches the originating node, which does the same.

> 💡 _This is basically a master / replica model, where the root node acts as the master and all other nodes are replicas. The root node determines the **correct** order of changes, resolving potential conflicts._

<br>

The whole process looks like this (you can also checkout the [live demo](https://codepen.io/lorean_victor/full/vYvBZKa)):

> ![0](./misc/diagram-red-0.svg) a patch is applied to observer #2 (for example, setting its value to `32`) \

> ![2](./misc/diagram-orange-2.svg) observer #1 up-propagates a similar patch with updated path to its parent, the root node:

> ```
> ![6](./misc/diagram-blue-6.svg) observers #3 and #1 notify their subscribers of change. \
> ![6](./misc/diagram-green-6.svg) observer #1 down-propagates a similar patch with altered path to its child, observer #2:
