`Ã¤ndern` helps with tracking changes across an object tree. Use it to wrap and modify an object, and you'd get [observables](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) notifying you when [some part of the object](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) changes, and [what the changes are](https://jsonpatch.com).

```js
import { createRoot } from 'andern'

const root = createRoot({
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ]
})

// ðŸ‘‡ subscribe to a part of the tree
root.child('/people/1').subscribe(console.log)

// ðŸ‘‡ manually set a specific part of the tree
root.child('/people/1/age').set('', 32)

// ðŸ‘‡ apply a patch to a specific part of the tree
root.child('/people').patch({ op: 'remove', path: '/1/age' })

```

# Installation

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):

```bash
npm i andern
```

Browser / [Deno](https://deno.land):

```js
import { createRoot } from 'https://esm.sh/andern'
```

<br>

# Usage

`Ã¤ndern` helps with propagating and tracking changes across some object (for example, managing application state). It treats the object as a tree: the root represents the whole object, and child nodes representing various parts of it. You can subscribe to different parts of the tree, modify or patch them, etc, and `Ã¤ndern` will make sure that all changes are propagated exactly to the correct subscribers.


ðŸ‘‰ Create a root node:
```js
import { createRoot } from 'andern'

const root = createRoot({
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ]
})
```
<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Get a child node:
```js
const john = root.child('/people/0')
```

> Child nodes are specified in [JSON Pointer](https://gregsdennis.github.io/Manatee.Json/usage/pointer.html) format.

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to a node's values:
```js
john.subscribe(console.log)
root.child('/people/1').subscribe(console.log)
```

> Each node is an [observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) that emits the current value of the node whenever it changes.

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Update the node:
```js
john.set('/name', 'Johnny')
```
```js
john.add('/title', 'Dr.')
```
```js
john.remove('/age')
```

> To change the whole object, use `''` as the path. Alternatively, you can use `node.next(...)`, as each node is also an [observer](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer).

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to its changes:
```js
john.patches.subscribe(console.log)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Apply a patch:
```js
john.patch({ op: 'replace', path: '/name', value: 'Johnny' })
```

> Changes are expressed in [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com) format.

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Use `.read()` method to get readonly nodes:

```js
const john = root.read('/people/0')
```

<br>

# Advanced Usage

### Nodes

The core construct of `Ã¤ndern` is the [`Node`](./src/node.ts) class, which tracks and notifies of changes in some part of an object tree.

```ts
class Node<T>
  extends Observable<T>
  implements Observer<T> {

  constructor(
    initial:  T,
    downstream: PatchStream,
    upstream: PatchChannel,
  );

  read(path: string): ReadonlyNode<T>;
  child(path: string): Node<T>;
  channel(): Observer<Patch>;
  patch(patch: Patch | Operation): this;
  set(path: string, value: any): this;  
  remove(path: string): this;

  // and some inherited methods
}
```

To create a `Node`, you need an _upstream_ and a _downstream_:

- _downstream_ should be a [`PatchStream`](./src/types.ts) (i.e. [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable)`<`[`Patch`](https://jsonpatch.com)`>`), through which the parent informs the node of changes to its value.

- _upstream_ should be a [`PatchChannel`](./src/types.ts) (i.e. [`Observer`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer)`<`[`Patch`](https://jsonpatch.com)`>`), through which the node informs its parent of requested changes to its value.

<br>

When a node is requested to change (through its `.set()`, `.remove()`, `.patch()`, or `.next()` methods), it will calculate the necessary changes and send them to _upstream_. It will apply the changes when they are received from the _downstream_, notifying subscribers ([read more](#how-it-works)).

Use this to create nodes with custom behavior. For example, this is a _root node_ that debounces incoming changes:

```ts
import { Node } from 'andern'
import { Subject, debounceTime } from 'rxjs'

const bounce = new Subject()
const root = new Node(
  { /* some initial value */},
  bounce.pipe(debounceTime(100)),
  bounce,
)
```

</div>

### Safety

A `Node` receiving a patch that it can't apply will result in an error, closing the stream. If you want to ignore such erroneous patches, use `SafeNode` class instead.

```ts
import { SafeNode } from 'andern'

const root = new SafeNode(
  /* ... */
)
```

<br>

> `createRoot()` uses `SafeNode` by default, so you don't need to worry about safety in normal use cases. You need to think about it only if you're creating custom nodes.

<br>

# How it Works

`Ã¤ndern` uses trees, composed of [`Node`s](#nodes), for tracking changes across objects. Each node is an [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) and an [`Observer`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer) for a designated part of the tree, represented by some [JSON pointer](https://gregsdennis.github.io/Manatee.Json/usage/pointer.html). For an object (tree) like this:

```js
const object = {
  people: [
    { name: 'John', age: 20 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  ],
  orgname: 'ACME',
}
```

You can track (or apply) changes to the organisation name like this:

```ts
const root = createRoot(object)
const orgname = root.child('/orgname')
```

and you can track (or apply) changes to the first person's name like this:

```ts
const john = root.child('/people/0/name')
```

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> `Ã¤ndern` does not track changes to the object itself, i.e it does not create proxies, or alter the original object in any way. A `Node` can only track changes that are applied by some other nodes in the same tree (i.e. having the same root).

<br>

When a node is requested to change (through its `.set()`, `.remove()`, `.patch()`, or `.next()` methods), it will calculate the necessary changes and send them to its _upstream_. In case of `.next()`, it diffs the current value and the _next_ value for calculating the patch (so its slower to use `.next()` compared to other methods).

The calculated patch won't be applied immediately, it will be sent to the _upstream_ first, where the parent will correct the _path_ of the patch, and send it upwards again. Eventually, the patch is bounced back by the root node (if it is a valid change), and will be downpropagated across the tree to nodes with a matching path (with the path again being corrected for each child node that receives the patch). During this process, the originating node will also receive the same patch from its _downstream_, applying the patch and notifying its subscribers.

The whole process looks like this (you can also checkout the [live demo](https://codepen.io/lorean_victor/full/vYvBZKa)):
